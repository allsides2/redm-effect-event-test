# RedM Particle Effect Tester

## Introduction

This script is designed to facilitate testing of particle effects (PTFX) in RedM. It allows you to cycle through various particle effects defined in the `ptfx_assets_non_looped` table and display them in-game for testing purposes.

## Features

- Automatically cycles through particle effects defined in the `ptfx_assets_non_looped` table.
- Displays each particle effect in-game for 5 seconds to allow for observation and testing.
- Provides feedback in the chat with information about the current particle effect being displayed.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the script installed in your RedM server's resources directory.
2. Start your RedM server.
3. In-game, use the `/test_all_effects` command to cycle through particle effects and display them.
4. Each particle effect will be shown in-game for 5 seconds before transitioning to the next one.
5. Monitor the chat for feedback about the current particle effect being displayed.

## Customization

You can customize the particle effects by modifying the `ptfx_assets_non_looped` table in the script file. Add or remove particle effects and their corresponding dictionaries to suit your testing requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Lua script file directly.
